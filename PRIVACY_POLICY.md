# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 13, 2025

## Introduction

Concret.io ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the Markdown for Humans extension ("Extension") for Visual Studio Code.

**This Privacy Policy complies with the Information Technology Act, 2000 of India and applicable data protection laws.**

## Information We Collect

### No Data Collection

**The Extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or user data.**

The Extension operates entirely locally on your device. All processing, including:
- Document editing and rendering
- Image processing and storage
- Export functionality (PDF, DOCX, HTML)
- Configuration settings

...occurs entirely on your local machine. No data is sent to external servers, analytics services, or third parties.

### Local Storage

The Extension may store configuration preferences locally on your device through VS Code's standard settings mechanism. This includes:
- Extension settings (e.g., `markdownForHumans.imagePath`, `markdownForHumans.chromePath`)
- VS Code theme preferences
- User-configured paths (e.g., Chrome path for PDF export)

These settings are stored locally by VS Code and are not transmitted to us or any third party.

### File Access

The Extension accesses markdown files on your local file system only when you explicitly open them. This access is:
- Limited to files you choose to open
- Performed entirely locally
- Not logged, transmitted, or stored externally

## Third-Party Services

The Extension uses the following third-party services:

### VS Code Marketplace

When you install the Extension through the VS Code Marketplace, Microsoft's standard marketplace privacy practices apply. We do not receive any personal information through the marketplace installation process.

### Chrome/Chromium (PDF Export)

When using the PDF export feature, the Extension uses your locally installed Chrome or Chromium browser. This process:
- Runs entirely on your local machine
- Does not transmit data to external servers
- Uses Chrome's standard PDF generation capabilities

## Data Security

**No Data Transmission:** Since the Extension does not collect, transmit, or store any data externally, there is no risk of data breach or unauthorized access to your information through the Extension's operation.

**Local Processing Only:** All file processing, editing, and data operations occur entirely on your local device. We do not have access to, and cannot access, your files, content, or data.

**Third-Party Services:** While the Extension may use third-party services (e.g., VS Code Marketplace for installation), we do not receive any personal information through these services. Any data collected by third-party services is subject to their respective privacy policies.

## Children's Privacy

The Extension is not intended for users under the age of 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect, process, or store information from children or minors. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the Extension, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information.

## Your Rights

Under applicable Indian laws, including the Information Technology Act, 2000, you have certain rights regarding your personal information. However, since we do not collect or store any personal information through the Extension, these rights are not applicable to Extension usage.

If you have questions about your privacy rights or wish to exercise any rights, please contact us at privacy@concret.io.

- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Posting a notice in the Extension's repository
- Including a notice in Extension updates (when applicable)

**Your continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. If you do not agree to the updated policy, you must stop using the Extension.**
