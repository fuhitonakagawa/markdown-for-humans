## Why We Built This

> **📌 Note:** *100% free. No trials. No limits. No paywalls, ever.*

### Writer-First, Human-First

Markdown for Humans is built on a simple belief: **writing should feel natural, not technical**. You shouldn't need to memorize syntax, dig through command palettes, or fight with your tools. You should just write.

We bring true WYSIWYG editing directly into VS Code with a **human-first design philosophy**:

- **Persistent formatting bar** — See your options, click what you need. No hunting through menus. 
- **Floating shortcuts** — Actions appear where you need them, when you need them, i.e. on Tables (right click), Images (More icon)
- **No command palette overload** — We keep actions visible and accessible, not buried in `/commands` or keyboard shortcuts you'll forget.
- **No context switching** — Everything you need is right there. Focus on your content, not syntax.

### The Problem We Solved

Existing markdown editors force writers to choose between:

- **Split-pane previews** that waste screen space and break your flow
- **Plain text editing** that requires memorizing syntax and breaks your concentration
- **Standalone apps** that don't integrate with your workflow
- **Command-heavy interfaces** that bury actions in overloaded palettes, requiring too much typing and mental overhead
- **Images:** Handling resolution, in-place resizing, size optimisation for large images, workspace directory storage and much more.

## Vibe Coded its way

This extension was built through AI / **vibe coding**, with minimal human effort focused on fixes and stability. The basic functional model came together in minutes, but what took days and hours was **testing each feature** to ensure everything works smoothly in real-world use. 

It's the classic 80:20 rule in action: that final 20% of polish, edge cases, and real-world testing takes 80% of the time, and that's where the real value lives.

We're open-sourcing this because in AI era, **code has limited value**, the real work was in the creativity in planning, design, and relentless testing. 

Countless hours went into vibe-coded wireframes, user experience design, and polish to create something that feels natural and intuitive.
