## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-16

### 🎯 What's New

#### Critical Bug Fix
**Fixed Auto-Linking Bug** — Previously, typing text ending with file extensions (like `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf`) would automatically convert them into links. This has been fixed! File extensions now remain as plain text, giving you complete control over when text becomes a link.

#### Enhanced Link Creation Experience
**Completely Redesigned Link Dialog** — Creating links is now faster and more intuitive:
- **Three Link Modes**: Switch between URL, File, and Headings with radio buttons positioned right after the Link Text input
- **Smart File Search**: Type to search workspace files with fuzzy matching and category filters (Markdown, Images, Code, Config)
- **In-Document Headings**: Instantly link to any heading (H1-H6) within your current document
- **Cleaner Display**: Shows only the filename or heading name in the input field, while storing the full path correctly
- **Better Navigation**: Fixed image and file link clicking - images now open in VS Code's preview, files open correctly in both development and packaged builds

#### Documentation & Discovery
- **Enhanced README** — Added comparison table showing how Markdown for Humans differs from other markdown editors
- **Improved Marketplace Listing** — Better keywords and descriptions to help users discover the extension more easily

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

This release includes several under-the-hood improvements that make the extension more stable and reliable:
- Enhanced test coverage for better reliability
- Improved CI/CD pipeline for faster packaging
- Code quality improvements
- Enabled pre-commit hook (previously disabled) - automatically fixes linting issues before commits
- Fixed GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline - now properly creates VSIX packages on push to main branch
- Improved test reliability and CI stability with enhanced Jest configuration

### Fixed (Technical Details)

- Fixed auto-linking bug where file extensions (.md, .txt, .pdf, etc.) and filenames ending with document extensions were incorrectly converted to links when typing
- Fixed lint regex and formatting issues in test files (image path resolution, image rename checks, image resize, and in-memory files tests)
- Fixed Jest configuration to resolve failing tests in CI pipeline
- Fixed pre-commit hook script for Windows system compatibility
- **Image Link Navigation**: Fixed image files not opening when clicked - now properly opens in VS Code's image preview
- **File Link Navigation**: Enhanced path resolution for both development and packaged builds
- **Path Resolution**: Improved relative path handling with fallback to workspace root when document-relative path fails
- **Link Click Handling**: Fixed preventDefault() and stopPropagation() to prevent browser from interfering with link navigation

### Added

- Added shouldAutoLink validation utility to prevent unwanted auto-linking of file extensions and bare filenames
- Added comprehensive test suite for link autolink prevention (src/__tests__/webview/linkAutolink.test.ts)
- Added pre-commit hook that automatically runs npm run lint:fix before each commit
- Added enhanced test setup files (setup-after-env.ts) for improved test reliability
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated package creation on push to main branch
- **Enhanced Link Dialog** - Completely redesigned link creation experience with three modes:
  - **URL Mode**: Create external links to websites
  - **File Mode**: Link to local files with intelligent fuzzy search and autocomplete
  - **Headings Mode**: Link to headings within the current document (H1-H6)
- **File Search with Filters**: Search workspace files with category filters (Markdown, Images, Code, Config)
- **Smart Path Display**: Shows only filename or heading text in the input field while storing the full path internally
- **Dynamic Label**: Link input label changes based on selected mode (URL/File/Heading)
- **Visual Differentiation**: Subtle colored borders in autocomplete results to distinguish files from headings

### Changed

- Enhanced marketplace discoverability: Updated displayName to "Markdown WYSIWYG Editor for Humans" to improve search ranking for "markdown editor" and "wysiwyg markdown" queries
- Expanded keywords from 6 to 30 terms for better marketplace visibility (includes: notion-like, writing, documentation, formatting, syntax-highlighting, live-preview, full-screen, distraction-free, cover-images, image-resizing, export, html, pdf, docx, human-friendly, and more)
- Updated package.json description to SEO-optimized version highlighting key features
- Restructured README with comparison table ("What Makes It Different") and improved SEO positioning
- Improved Jest test configuration with better coverage thresholds and setup files
- Updated test files to use more robust patterns and improved error handling
- **Link Dialog UX**: Radio buttons moved to appear right after Link Text input for better workflow
- **Button Alignment**: Cancel and OK buttons aligned to the right side of the dialog
- **Autocomplete UI**: Removed emojis, replaced with clean borders for a more professional appearance
- **Dropdown Sizing**: Autocomplete dropdown now dynamically adjusts height to prevent overflow in different modes

### Developer Experience

- Enabled pre-commit hook (previously disabled) - automatically fixes linting issues before commits
- Fixed GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline - now properly creates VSIX packages on push to main branch
- Improved test reliability and CI stability with enhanced Jest configuration
