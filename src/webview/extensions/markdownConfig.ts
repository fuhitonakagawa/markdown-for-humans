/**
 * Custom Markdown Configuration
 *
 * NOTE: This file is currently NOT USED.
 * It was intended to extend tiptap-markdown for custom image serialization.
 *
 * With the migration to @tiptap/markdown, custom serialization would need
 * to use the MarkdownManager API (editor.markdown.serialize).
 *
 * TODO: If custom image path handling is needed, implement using:
 * - Custom tokenizers: https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/markdown/advanced-usage/custom-tokenizer
 * - Extension handlers: https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/markdown/guides/integrate-markdown-in-your-extension
