## Development Philosophy

### Core Tenets

**1. Ship Early, Iterate Fast**
- Get MVP in users' hands quickly
- Real user feedback > speculation
- Small, frequent releases beat big launches

**2. Performance First**
- Optimize from day one, not "later"
- Profile before optimizing (data-driven decisions)
- User perception matters more than benchmarks

**3. Progressive Enhancement**
- Core features work everywhere
- Advanced features enhance experience
- Graceful degradation (no hard failures)

**4. Community-Driven**
- Prioritize based on user feedback
- Encourage contributions (code, docs, design)
- Be responsive to issues and PRs

**5. Reading Experience > Feature Completeness**
- Better to have 80% of features with 120% reading quality
- Typography isn't decoration—it's the core value proposition
- Test every change by reading a 3000+ word doc

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Reading Experience is PARAMOUNT

**Philosophy:**
> Writing markdown should feel like writing in a premium publishing tool, not a code editor.

#### Typography Excellence

**Body Text:**
- **Fonts**: Inherit from VS Code editor font settings (respects user preferences and OS defaults)
- **Size**: 20% larger than base editor font (calc(var(--md-base-size) * 1.2)) for comfortable reading
- **Line height**: 1.58-1.6 for breathing room
- **Max width**: 680-740px (optimal reading length, ~80 characters)
- **Letter spacing**: Negative tracking for larger text (-0.003em to -0.022em)

**Why This Matters:**
- Users spend HOURS reading documentation
- Markdown files are documentation, not code
- Eye strain is real—optimize for long reading sessions
- Medium.com's typography isn't trendy, it's scientifically optimal

**Non-Negotiables:**
- Never sacrifice reading comfort for "fitting more on screen"
- Inherit VS Code fonts (respects user preferences, OS defaults, accessibility)
- Generous spacing (white space is a feature, not waste)
- Large, legible text (20% larger than base font, users who want small text can read source)
- Readability optimizations (line-height, letter-spacing, font-smoothing, text-rendering)

#### Headers

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- **H1-H6**: Inherit from body font, bold, size multipliers create hierarchy (2.4x, 2x, 1.6x, etc.)
- **Spacing**: More space above than below (visual grouping)
- **Line height**: Tighter for headers (1.25 for h1-h3, 1.2 for h4-h6)

**Purpose:**
- Headers create scannable structure
- Users should be able to skim and find sections quickly
- Headers are signposts, not decorations

#### Emphasis

**Formatting:**
- **Bold** should feel strong (increased weight)
- **Italic** should feel elegant (true italics, not slanted)
- **Code** should clearly stand out from prose

### 2. Tables: Clean & Professional

**Balance:**
- Tables need to be **functional** (good for data)
- But **not dominate** the reading experience
- Professional table styling with clear visual hierarchy

**Requirements:**
- Clear borders (not overly thick)
- Adequate padding (12-16px)
- Hover feedback (subtle highlight)
- Header distinction (subtle background, bold text)

### 3. Code Blocks

**Style:**
- Subtle background (not harsh gray blocks)
- Good contrast but not jarring
- Professional monospace fonts (SF Mono, Cascadia Code, Consolas)
- Syntax highlighting (GitHub-style colors)

### 4. Theme Adaptability

#### System Theme Inheritance (The "Chameleon")
**Philosophy:** Respect the user's VS Code environment

**Implementation:**
- Inherit `var(--vscode-editor-background)` and `--vscode-editor-foreground`
- Seamless integration with ANY VS Code theme (Dracula, Monokai, Solarized, etc.)
- User's chosen theme extends to markdown editing

#### Reading Modes (The "Override")
**Philosophy:** Sometimes users want specific reading conditions

**Modes:**
1. **System Mode** - Inherits VS Code theme (default)
2. **Light Mode** - Classic paper-like experience (off-white background)
3. **Dark Mode** - True dark for night reading
4. **Sepia Mode** - Warm, low-contrast for reduced eye strain

### 5. Inspiration Sources

**Best-in-Class Examples:**

| Source | What We Learn |
|--------|---------------|
| **Medium.com** | Body typography, spacing, reading flow |
| **Modern WYSIWYG editors** | Table styling, element indicators, clean UI |
| **Notion** | Contextual formatting toolbar, hover states |
| **iA Writer** | Focus mode, typography obsession |

**Design Lessons:**
- **Medium**: Prioritize readability over information density
- **Modern editors**: Clean, unobtrusive UI elements
- **Notion**: Discoverability without clutter
- **iA Writer**: Typography IS the interface

### 6. Decision Framework

**When making design decisions, ask:**

1. **Does this improve the reading experience?** ← MOST IMPORTANT
2. Does this reduce cognitive load?
3. Does this feel premium/polished?
4. Would I want to read a 10-page doc in this?
5. Does this respect the content?

**Red Flags (Avoid):**
- "Let's make the font smaller to fit more"
- "Users can just zoom in if they want"
- "Code editors use 14px, so should we"
- "White space is wasted space"
- "Tables are more important than paragraphs"

**Green Lights (Good):**
- "This feels like reading a well-designed book"
- "I could read this for hours without strain"
- "This makes the content feel important"
- "The UI disappears, content shines"

### 7. Success Metrics for Design

**How we know we're winning:**
- Users read docs without reaching for the zoom
- "This looks like a published article" reactions
- Low eye strain (can read for 30+ min comfortably)
- Users WANT to write in our editor (not just for WYSIWYG convenience)

### 8. Technical Implementation of Design

**CSS Hierarchy (Priority Order):**

1. **Base typography** (body, paragraphs) - 70% of reading time
2. **Headers** - Visual structure
3. **Tables, lists, quotes** - Supporting elements
4. **Code** - Technical content
5. **UI elements** (toolbar, indicators) - Should be subtle

**Never:**
- Sacrifice body text size for "consistency"
- Use code editor fonts for prose
- Optimize for "information density" over readability
- Ship with 14px body text

### 9. Test with Real Content

**Always test changes with:**
- A 3000+ word document
- Tables with real data (not lorem ipsum)
- Mix of code and prose
- Reading for 10+ minutes (experience eye strain if present)

## AI Coding Assistant Integration

### Planning Workflow

We use a **planning-first workflow** where plans are created using any AI coding tool or manually. Plans are:
- **Public** - Available in the repository for transparency
- **Active work** - Once locked and ready, moved to `roadmap/pipeline/[name].md`
- **Completed work** - Moved to `roadmap/shipped/` when done

### Creating Plans with Your Favorite Tool

**📝 Start with the template:** Use [`roadmap/task-plan-template.md`](../roadmap/task-plan-template.md) as your starting point. It provides a structured format with hints for each section.

You can create plan files using any AI coding tool (Cursor, Antigravity, Windsurf, Claude Code, etc.) or manually:

1. **Use the template**: 
   - Prompt your AI tool: "Create a task plan using `roadmap/task-plan-template.md` for [feature name]"
   - Or copy the template and fill it in manually
   - The template includes placeholders and hints to guide you

2. **Create a markdown file**: 
   - If your tool has a plan feature (like Cursor), use it — plans are typically created in tool-specific locations (e.g., `.cursor/plans/`)
   - If your tool doesn't have a plan mode, just **prompt the AI to create a markdown file** based on the template in `roadmap/pipeline/[name].md`
   - You can also create markdown files manually using the template as a guide

3. **Plan location**: 
   - **Best practice**: Create directly in `roadmap/pipeline/` to keep everything organized
   - If created in a tool-specific location (like `.cursor/plans/`), move it when ready:
     ```bash
     git mv [source-location]/[name].md roadmap/pipeline/[name].md
     ```

4. **Move to shipped when complete**:
   ```bash
   git mv roadmap/pipeline/[name].md roadmap/shipped/
   ```

**Key point**: Don't worry if your tool doesn't have a special "plan mode" — just prompt the AI to create a markdown file using the template, or create one manually. The important part is having a well-drafted plan document following the template structure.

### AGENTS.md Standard

Our `AGENTS.md` file follows the [agents.md](https://agents.md/) standard, which is supported by many AI coding assistants (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude, etc.). The file references:
- `roadmap/pipeline/*.md` - Active implementation plans
- `roadmap/shipped/*.md` - Completed plans
- `vibe-coding-rules/` - Detailed coding guides

### Plan Lifecycle

1. **Draft** → Create plan anywhere (tool-specific location or `roadmap/pipeline/`)
2. **Ready** → Move to `roadmap/pipeline/` when locked and ready for implementation
3. **Complete** → Move to `roadmap/shipped/` when feature is done and tests pass

See [roadmap/README.md](../roadmap/README.md) for detailed planning workflow and tool-specific guidance.

Contributors using any AI coding assistant can benefit from:
- `AGENTS.md` instructions (read by most modern agents)
- `vibe-coding-rules/` coding guides (public and accessible)
- `roadmap/` planning documents (public specifications)
